            <p>By creating an account and using Pause, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to this Privacy
                Policy. Where required by law, your use of features that collect sensitive data constitutes explicit

            <p>During onboarding, we request an explicit checkbox consent for AI processing used to generate features
                such as verdicts and insights. If you later withdraw this consent, some AI-powered features may stop
                working until consent is restored.</p>
