      "userA": {
        "input": "My partner keeps setting the thermostat to 68°F which is freezing! I need it at 74°F to be comfortable. Every time I change it, they change it back within an hour. I've started wearing three sweaters around the house.",
        "feelings": "I feel like my comfort doesn't matter. It's my home too and I shouldn't have to bundle up like I'm going camping."
      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "The apartment is already warm enough! 74 degrees is way too hot and it's wasting money on electricity. I wake up sweating every night. They could just put on a sweater instead of cranking up the heat.",
        "feelings": "I feel dismissed when my partner ignores the energy bill and my sleep quality. Being too hot makes me cranky."

        "input": "I made myself a fancy sandwich with the last of the good deli turkey and special cheese for tomorrow's lunch. I labeled it clearly with my name and a 'DO NOT EAT' note. Came home to find the container empty in the sink.",

        "input": "I was starving and running late for a meeting. There was literally nothing else in the fridge except that sandwich. I was going to replace everything at the store later but they came home before I could.",
        "feelings": "I feel bad but also a bit attacked. It was an emergency hunger situation! I didn't mean to cause drama."

        "input": "We agreed to watch the new season of our favorite show together. I come home and find out they watched 4 episodes without me while I was at my mom's for the weekend!",

        "input": "They were gone for THREE days! I was bored and it auto-played. Also they were on their phone during half the episodes we watched together anyway so I didn't think they cared that much.",

      "userA": {
        "input": "I created a fair chore chart two months ago. My partner has 'forgotten' to do their assigned tasks 6 times now. Meanwhile I've done mine plus picked up their slack because I can't live in a messy house.",

      "userB": {
        "input": "The chore chart is way too rigid! Life happens - sometimes I'm tired from work or have other things going on. They always do the chores before I even get a chance, then act like a martyr about it.",
        "feelings": "I feel controlled and criticized. I'm not a child who needs a chart to function."

        "input": "My partner invited their parents to stay with us for a WEEK without asking me first. I found out when their mom texted me asking what kind of pillows we have. Our apartment is tiny!",

        "input": "My parents are only in town once a year and hotels are expensive. I didn't think it would be a big deal - they're family! Also my partner loves my parents and always says they're welcome anytime.",

      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "I just like to keep my relationship private! Social media isn't real life. I show my love in person, not through performative posts. They know I love them - why do strangers need to know too?",
        "feelings": "I feel pressured to perform our relationship online when that's not my style."

      "userA": {
        "input": "My partner's snoring has gotten so bad I haven't had a full night's sleep in weeks. I've nicely suggested they see a doctor or try those nose strips but they refuse and say I'm exaggerating.",

      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "I can't help that I snore! It's a natural body function. They've started sleeping in the guest room which hurts my feelings. Also they definitely snore too sometimes, they just don't hear themselves.",
        "feelings": "I feel self-conscious and rejected. It's not like I'm snoring on purpose."

        "input": "Every single time we try to decide on dinner, my partner says 'I don't care, you pick' and then vetoes every single suggestion I make. We went through 7 restaurant ideas last night before they finally picked sushi - which they wanted all along!",
        "feelings": "I feel frustrated and like they're playing games. Just tell me what you want!"
      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "I genuinely don't know what I want until I hear the options! It's not my fault none of their suggestions sounded good. Also they suggested pizza THREE times when they know I'm trying to eat healthier.",
        "feelings": "I feel pressured to make decisions when I'm indecisive by nature. Why is picking dinner such high stakes?"

      "userA": {
        "input": "My partner sets 7 alarms starting at 5:30am, snoozes all of them, and doesn't actually get up until 7am. I have to lie there listening to their phone blast every 10 minutes for 90 minutes every single morning.",

      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "I physically cannot wake up to just one alarm, I've tried everything! It's just how my body works. They're a light sleeper which isn't my fault. Maybe they should try earplugs?",
        "feelings": "I feel like I'm being blamed for something I can't control. At least I'm trying to wake up on time!"

        "feelings": "I feel like I'm not a priority. If you can text other people, you can text me."
      },
      "userB": {
        "input": "Sometimes I see a text and plan to respond thoughtfully later, then I forget. Group chats are different - those are quick jokes, not conversations. They want me to drop everything instantly which feels controlling.",
        "feelings": "I feel monitored and suffocated. I need some communication autonomy."
