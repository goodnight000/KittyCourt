# I18n Page Translation Follow-up

## Summary
- Added missing translation keys for remaining pages/components in English and Simplified Chinese (court flow, cases, dashboard, economy, auth pages, insights, memories, profile, paywall, and shared UI states).
- Filled dynamic copy lists for the loading screen, court idle phrases, deliberation quotes, and dashboard good-deed suggestions.
- Added Simplified Chinese labels for preset avatars and the common profile alt text.
